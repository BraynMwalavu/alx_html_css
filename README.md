- Element alignment and spacing using CSS properties

### 📱 Responsive Web Design
- Pages styled to adapt to different screen sizes using flexible units
- Emphasis on readability and user experience across devices

## 📄 Files

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure copied from the previous project

This project lays the groundwork for more advanced frontend techniques in 
later modules.
